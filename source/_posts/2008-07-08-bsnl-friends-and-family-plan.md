This tip is about activating the friends and family (FNF) plan in BSNL mobile.
Applicable to only the residents of India.

According to this plan u can call to any two numbers, of your choice, at a rate of 10ps per minute.

The following are the conditions:

1.  Both the numbers should be BSNL numbers.
2.  One number should be a landline number and other should be mobile number.
3.  You can change the numbers after 6 months.

Just do the following:

* Send <strong>FFE</strong> &lt;space&gt; &lt;land phone number&gt; &lt;space&gt; &lt;mobile number&gt;  to <strong>53733</strong>

The method is same for both activation and changing the numbers. (Change possible only after 6 months).

Happy talking.... :)
