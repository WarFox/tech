<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;" trbidi="on"><h2>Problem:</h2>Drive not accessible and giving the following error.<br /><code><i>Parameter is incorrect</i></code><br /><br /><h2>Symptoms:</h2>Cannot open logical drive in Windows operating system using explorer or using command prompt.<br /><br /><h2>Reason:</h2>Due to bad sector in HDD<br /><br /><h2>Possible solution:</h2><code>CHKDSK E: /F /R /X</code><br /><br />If you know any other reason or solution please comment or email. <p><h4>Spoiler Alert</h4>Check disk on and fixing errors on the fly is going to take a lot lot of time. Our friend Sushil's system took more than 13 hours to do it. So readers, you will need to find some other way to entertain yourself when a CHKDSK command is running. </p></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><div style="border-top: 1px solid #efefef; margin-top: 5px;">
