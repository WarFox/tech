Hi folks, this tip is for the DBAâ€™s and developers who do the tedious task - Daily back up of database!!! Every day run a script to export oracle database.Each day you would have to modify your export batch file with the current date and to do it. I thought of creating a batch file that accepts the user name and password and then exports the database and creates a dump file with auto filename. You will get a new dump file each day,with the date appended in the file name. No need of manually giving the date.
Copy paste the below code to create a batch file (*.bat)
cls
@echo off
REM Export Full database with auto filename for dump and log
REM This batch file will create the dump and log files in the same directory as of batch
REM File name syntax --> <SCHEMANAME>_<DD>_<MM>_<YYYY>
