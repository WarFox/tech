Rooting an Android device allows the access to root user in the operating system. I needed to get root access in order to unlock my phone from the network. It is pretty simple procedure and I followed the instructions given at [androidforums][1]. While rooting, my device was running Gingerbread 2.3.6
Step by step instructions for rooting the device is clearly given in the Android forum post by victors1995. My device had no issues after rooting. You will see a new launcher called super user in your software list, which can be used to grant or revoke super user capabilities to other apps. I went ahead and installed [Busybox free][2] and [Root checker basic][3].

After rooting I also [unlocked my phone from the network][4].
<strong>NB: Do this at your own risk. Rooting may void the warranty of your device.</strong>
