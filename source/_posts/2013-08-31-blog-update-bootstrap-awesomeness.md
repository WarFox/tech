Yesterday, I spend some to change the blog template using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap</a>.
 
Thanks to Blogger's new template editor. Now it is much easier to understand the templates.

The template was built on top of my older template <tt>Simple</tt> by <a href="http://noaesthetic.com">Joshua Peterson</a>. The process was simple and straight forward.
 
Blogger templates are mostly collection of widgets. I introduced few new divs with Bootstrap classes and removed few divs from older template. Bootstrap documentation has everything clearly explained along with examples.
 
I haven't tested this new template on all screens yet.
