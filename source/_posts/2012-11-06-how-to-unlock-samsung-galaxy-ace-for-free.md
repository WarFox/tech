My phone was locked to 3 network here in UK and I badly needed to unlock it because my other phone got damaged and couldn't afford to get a new phone. You can get an unlock code from your service provider by making a payment of Â£15 (when writing this blog), in UK. I would rather spent my money on beer than on phone unlock codes. Any how, I got a solution for this and here I am sharing it with you.

This method is recommended for Samsung Galaxy Ace (GT-S5830) only and when I did this my phone was running on Gingerbread version 2.3.6. However, the developer claims it may work in the following models too.

* Samsung 5 Europe (i5500)
* Samsung 551 Callisto (i5510)
* Samsung (i5700)
* Samsung 3 (i5800)
* Samsung Pro (i5510)
* Samsung Galaxy mini (S5570)
* Samsung Fit (S5670)
* Samsung Ace (S5830)
* Samsung Pro (B7510)

I would also add, that the paid method is definitely risk free and safer than this method.

Before proceeding check your phone lock status by dialing *#7465625#. The Network Lock should be [ON] now.

First you need <a href="/2012/11/how-to-root-your-samsung-galaxy-ace.html">to root your galaxy ace</a>. <a href="/2012/11/how-to-root-your-samsung-galaxy-ace.html">Procedure for rooting the android</a> device can be found in my previous <a href="/2012/11/how-to-root-your-samsung-galaxy-ace.html">post</a>.

Secondly, you MUST install <a href="http://goo.gl/JOPF8">BusyBox</a>. Otherwise unlock codes wont be visible. {Thanks much to Asok and Ratty (commenters) for notifying this.}

Then download and install <a href="http://goo.gl/lT2Yz">Galaxy Ace Unlock</a> by <a href="http://goo.gl/D5Cg4">Helroz</a>

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxyaceunlock">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helroz.galaxyaceunlock</a>

This app can be run only on a  rooted device. There are only 3 steps to get your phone unlock code

## Getting the unlock key
1. Run the app
2. Touch on the option given. <em>Unlock. See your sim unlock code</em>

* Confirm your choice by selecting Yes on the next screen.

* Wait till the app shows the unlock codes.

The app extracts the network unlock code from the phone and shows it for you. It may give upto 4 different unlock codes. In my case all the four unlock codes were same. Note down the unlock codes.
Once you have the unlock codes, switch off your phone and boot it with an unsupported sim card.

When the phone boots it will ask for the unlock code.
Key in the unlock code. Do not try the same unlock code more than once. Any one of the unlock code will have worked.
If the unlock is successful it will display this message. <strong>Network unlock successful.</strong>

Now if you dial *#7465625#, the Network Lock will be [OFF].

That confirms you have successfully unlocked your phone from the network.
