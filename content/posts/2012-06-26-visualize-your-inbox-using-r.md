I just found an interesting R script that can visualize your email inbox.

(Thanks to M Mouse for the updated link.)

The script creates a Graph using 'from' and 'to' addresses of the messages in your inbox. I din't have to do any modification in the script, it worked directly for me in my gmail.

This is how my inbox looks like!
