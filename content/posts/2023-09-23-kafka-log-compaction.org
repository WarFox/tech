How does it relate to transactions is Kafka.

https://docs.confluent.io/kafka/operations-tools/partition-determination.html
A topic partition is the unit of parallelism in Apache KafkaÂ®.

For both producers and brokers, writes to different partitions can be done in
parallel. This frees up hardware resources for expensive operations such as
compression.

If you want to change the number of partitions or replicas of your Kafka topic,
you can use a streaming transformation to automatically stream all of the
messages from the original topic into a new Kafka topic that has the desired
number of partitions or replicas.
