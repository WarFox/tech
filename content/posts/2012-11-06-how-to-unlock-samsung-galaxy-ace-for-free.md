My phone was locked to 3 network here in UK and I badly needed to unlock it
because my other phone got damaged and couldn't afford to get a new phone. You
can get an unlock code from your service provider by making a payment of Â£15
(when writing this blog), in UK. I would rather spent my money on beer than on
phone unlock codes. Any how, I got a solution for this and here I am sharing it
with you.

This method is recommended for Samsung Galaxy Ace (GT-S5830) only and when I did
this my phone was running on Gingerbread version 2.3.6. However, the developer
claims it may work in the following models too.

* Samsung 5 Europe (i5500)
* Samsung 551 Callisto (i5510)
* Samsung (i5700)
* Samsung 3 (i5800)
* Samsung Pro (i5510)
* Samsung Galaxy mini (S5570)
* Samsung Fit (S5670)
* Samsung Ace (S5830)
* Samsung Pro (B7510)

I would also add, that the paid method is definitely risk free and safer than
this method.

Before proceeding check your phone lock status by dialing *#7465625#. The
Network Lock should be [ON] now.

First you need [to root your galaxy
ace](/how-to-root-your-samsung-galaxy-ace). [Procedure for rooting the
android](/how-to-root-your-samsung-galaxy-ace) device can be found in my
previous [post](/how-to-root-your-samsung-galaxy-ace).

Secondly, you MUST install [BusyBox](https://goo.gl/JOPF8). Otherwise unlock
codes wont be visible. *Thanks much to Asok and Ratty (commenters) for notifying
this.*

Then download and install [Galaxy Ace Unlock](https://goo.gl/lT2Yz) by
[Helroz](https://goo.gl/D5Cg4)

This app can be run only on a rooted device. There are only 3 steps to get your
phone unlock code

## Getting the unlock key
1. Run the app
2. Touch on the option given. **Unlock. See your sim unlock code**

* Confirm your choice by selecting *Yes* on the next screen.

* Wait till the app shows the unlock codes.

The app extracts the network unlock code from the phone and shows it for you. It
may give upto 4 different unlock codes. In my case all the four unlock codes
were same. Note down the unlock codes. Once you have the unlock codes, switch
off your phone and boot it with an unsupported sim card.

When the phone boots it will ask for the unlock code. Key in the unlock code. Do
not try the same unlock code more than once. Any one of the unlock code will
have worked. If the unlock is successful it will display this message.
**Network unlock successful**.

Now if you dial *#7465625#, the Network Lock will be [OFF].

![Network lock off](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M6SxKa3Qa1Q/UJlNtvxnUoI/AAAAAAAADxQ/hv9O0fyrzjU/s1600/SC20121106-174519.png "Network lock off")

That confirms you have successfully unlocked your phone from the network, well done!
