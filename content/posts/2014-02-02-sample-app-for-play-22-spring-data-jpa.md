I have made a sample application to demo Play! framework 2.2, Spring data jpa and Backbonejs.

It is available at  <a href="https://github.com/WarFox/play-spring-data-jpa-backbonejs">https://github.com/WarFox/play-spring-data-jpa-backbonejs</a>.

Also a demo app is hosted in Heroku at <a href="https://play-spring-data-jpa-backbone.herokuapp.com/">https://play-spring-data-jpa-backbone.herokuapp.com/</a>

It started as a fork from <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/play-spring-data-jpa/">https://github.com/typesafehub/play-spring-data-jpa</a> and then created a separated repo to include backbonjs.

Feel free to fork and play with it.
