Moving my homepage to [[https://gridsome.org/][Gridsome]] and Vue was great choice because of the
simplicity of VueJS. I'm happy with the choice of Vue.

However, [[https://gridsome.org/][Gridsome]] has been [[https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/issues/1289][lagging]] lagging behind on the new advances available
in Vue3. Also I realise I'm not using any advanced features from [[https://gridsome.org/][Gridsome]] for
my homepage.

I've been looking at [[https://nuxtjs.org/][NuxtJS]] for sometime now and it looks really good choice.
[[https://nuxtjs.org/][NuxtJS]] seems a lot simpler than [[https://gridsome.org/][Gridsome]]. I also wanted to start using [[https://www.typescriptlang.org/][TypeScript]].

The migration was simple enough as seen in this [[https://github.com/WarFox/deepumohan.com/pull/9/][pr]]. I also a wrote a new
Component in TypeScript that mimics a typewriter behaviour.
