As a software engineer, you do a lot of text searches from time to time on your machine or some machine somewhere in the data centre or in cloud :cloud:.

Here I'm documenting the tools that I like to use.

Example for search with

# ripgrep

[riggrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a tool written in Rust and was first released on [Sept 6 2016](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/0.0.1).
`ripgrep` respects `.gitignore` file by default and that makes it super useful.

group

# grep

find grep example, with line number and group

# Sift

sift --git --line-number --group --write-config

# PT
