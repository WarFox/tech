It's been so long since I've re-written my homepage.

It started orginially as a plain html file, custom css, bootstrap, fontawesome,
and google font.

This is how the =<head></head>= looked like.

#+begin_src html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/fontawesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" />

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora:400,400italic,700,700italic|Bitter:400&subset=latin,latin-ext" media="all" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css" />
#+end_src

As you can imagine, that's a a lot of static assets to download for a simple
homepage. Although hopefully fontawesome, bootstrap, and google fonts are
already cached is most browsers!.

Here I had to write the content in pure html and was hard to maintain.

Things like privacy-policy and terms of use were very difficult to maintain as
html files.

** New and shiny

The new homepage is built using [[https://gridsome.org][gridsome]] which is built on top of [[https://vuejs.org][vue.js]]. CSS in
the new homepae is handled by tailwindcss.

Now the content is written in markdown and gridsome does the heavy lifting of
creating static html and optimized javascript. Tailwind and Purgecss creates
optimizd css files.
