It's been so long after I've rewrote my homepage.

This was written using plain html, custom css, bootstrap, fontawesome, and google font.

#+begin_src html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/fontawesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" />

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora:400,400italic,700,700italic|Bitter:400&subset=latin,latin-ext" media="all" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css" />
#+end_src

That's a a lot for a simple homepage (although hopefully fontawesome, bootstrap,
and google fonts are already cached is most browsers!)

Here I had to write everything with pure html and is hard to maintain.

Things like privacy-policy and terms of use were very difficult to maintain as
html files.

** New and shiny

The new homepage is built using [[https://gridsome.org][gridsome]] which is built on top of [[https://vuejs.org][vue.js]]. CSS in
the new homepae is handled by tailwindcss.

Now the content is written in markdown and gridsome does the heavy lifting of
creating static html and optimized javascript. Tailwind and Purgecss creates
optimizd css files.
