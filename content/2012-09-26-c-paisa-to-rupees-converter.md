The following gist is a paisa to rupee converter written in C++. It is nothing important and does not do anything exciting. It was just an attempt of mine to write some C++ code after more than eight years. This was the simplest idea that came to my mind.

Objective was to use separate header files, pointers and class references, static member functions and polymorphism in a program.
